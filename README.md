# Netpractice

## Description

**NetPractice** is a networking project that focuses on understanding and solving network topology issues, 
configuring subnets, and managing routing tables. 
This project helped me strengthen my knowledge of networking principles and troubleshoot real-world scenarios.

Additionally, I extended my research to study the OSI model and its layers in depth, differentiating each layer's functionality.
Using tools like **Wireshark**, I captured and observed network traffic, gaining insights into how protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS operate in real-time.
